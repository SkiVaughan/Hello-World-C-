Methods
Same class (call it by its name and the parameters)
different class objectName.MethodName

Local Variables are declared within the body of a method, and are only avalable within that method.
Instance Variable can be used anywhere in the class (associated with an object) 

Chapter 4- Classes and Objects
Blueprint of the project
- Attributes (instance variables)
- Behaviors (methods)
define methods
calling methods (from within the same class or from another class)

Get and set access methods {get : set}
Properties
Auto-implemented properties
- One line of code that acheives all of the (get set) 
Constructers 
- If we do not create our own constructor, the compiler will give us the default constructor
DOES NOT RETURN DATA
Methods can have inputs, These are defined through parameters (pieces of info that the method needs to execute)
- public void Changepin(string newPin) (1 parameter)
- public void ChangePassword() (0 parameters AKA emtpy parameter list)

Methods can return data
- public int AddNumbers(int n1, int n2)

Chapter 5-Control Structures
Sequential Flow 
Selection
- If
- If-Else
- Nested if-else
- Switch

switch(grade>=80) // This would be a T/F which would end up running the default case
{
  case 100:
   Console.WriteLine("Perfect")
    break;
case 90:
   Console.WriteLine("Great Job")
    break;
case 80:
   Console.WriteLine("I know you can do better")
    break;
default
........
break;

}

Repitition (looping)
- While loop (counter-controlled, sentinal-controlled)
- Do-While
- For 
- Foreach (you can't set values for the elements)

Chapter 7- Methods

Purpose of Methods
Method Headers
- Return type
- Parameters of a method
Methods body
Method Signature (name of the method and its parameters)
Calling Methods

From the same class (call by the method's name and provide the arguments that match the paramters
from another class (create an object and call by objectname.MethodName and provide arguments

Chapter 10 
Overloaded contructors
Default constructor (when does the compler prves a default constructor and when not)
Parameterless contructor (no-argument contructor)
this keyword 
ToString Method
Compostion
Inhertitance
